## Actor on Go
This is my journey for playing actor based concurrent model using [proto.actor](github.com/AsynkronIT/protoactor-go).

## Why Actors

* Decoupled Concurrency
* Distributed by default
* Fault tolerance

For a more indepth description of the differences, see this thread [Actors vs. CSP](https://www.quora.com/Go-programming-language-How-are-Akka-actors-are-different-than-Goroutines-and-Channels)
